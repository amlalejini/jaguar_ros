# jaguar_ros
This project is a rewrite/refactoring of the Dr. Robot Jaguar's ROS code.  The jaguar_player is a refactoring of the drrobot_player node, and the motion sensor driver files are a refactoring of the original drrobot motion sensor driver files.

It is also relevant to note that the axis.py Axis Camera driver included in the pynodes directory is a modified version of the official Axis Camera node.  As such, I take no credit for the functionality of that driver.

## Dependencies
